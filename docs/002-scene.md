# What is a Scene?

For Scriptaverse a scene can be considered a collection of 3D objects and 2D texture.

I like to think of it as an immersive diorama or room.

## Definition

The objects in a scene and the scene itself can be configured to use a set of definitions, which include:

* 3D object scale and position
* 2D graphich scale and position
* Teleport location list - a list of locations to teleport the user to

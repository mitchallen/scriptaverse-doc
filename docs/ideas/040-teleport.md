# Teleport

To navigate within a scene I decided to go with teleportation for the following reason:

* In VR users become nauseous if you move them around
* Even when experimenting with moving the user on a desktop, using a 49" curved monitor I found myself feeling ill
* Easy to implement
* No need for visible controller, like a fishing pole type device to target a new location
* Easy to port the behavior to desktop and mobile devices

:::tip Nothing is cast in stone

There are no concrete rules here.  If you are a software developer, you can implement whatever type of movement you prefer.

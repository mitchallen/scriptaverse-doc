# Desktop Usage

The Scriptaverse site supports desktop, mobile and WebXR. 

That works with the latest Oculus / Meta Browser update within their VR headsets.

I've tested with the following browsers on:

* **Chrome**
* **Brave**
* **Safari**

See below for instructions.

## Browser buttons

To simulate the headset functionality: when in desktop or mobile touch screen mode you will see the following buttons at the top of the screen:

* **Help** - The link to this doc site
* **Next** - Move to the next scene
* **Random** - Move to a ***random*** next scene
* **Teleport** - Teleport to the next position within the scene

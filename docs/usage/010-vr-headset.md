# VR Headset

The Scriptaverse site supports **WebXR**. That works with the latest Oculus / Meta Browser update within their VR headsets.

I've tested it on:

* **Meta (Oculus) Quest 2**
* **Oculus Go**

See below for instructions.

## Meta Quest 2 (formerly Oculus Quest)

1. Within your Quest headset, open up the Oculus / Meta Browser
2. Browse to: https://scriptaverse.com
3. Bookmark it for future reference
4. Click the button on the bottom of the screen that says ***"Enter VR"***
5. If this is your first time you will be prompted to for permission to proceed
6. Once inside the VR environment, use the triggers on each device to do the following:
  * **Next Scene** - Use the trigger on one controller to navigate to the next scene
  * **Teleport** - Use the trigger on the other controller to teleport to the next position within the scene
  * **Menu / Exit** - Use the ***Oculus Button*** on the controller to pull up the menu / exit option

## Oculus Go

The instructions are similar to the Meta Quest. The difference being the triggers:
* **Next Scene** - triggered by a touchpad click
* **Teleport** - triggered by clicking the index trigger
